# Research Agent

> Once people said "Talk is cheap. Show me the code." But now in the era of vibe coding, I think the reverse might be true: your ability to create a new idea is far more important than being able to implement it.
>
> With this idea in mind, this project is created to accelerate the idea-to-real-code step.

A project-agnostic autonomous research loop for Claude Code. Give one idea, get a results summary.

```
/auto-research <your idea here>
```

Examples of what you can give as input:

```bash
# A rough technique idea
/auto-research add residual attention gates to the decoder skip connections

# A specific parameter change
/auto-research increase learning rate warmup from 5 to 20 epochs

# A concept from a paper you read
/auto-research use boundary-aware loss from nnUNet v2 to weight hard regions

# A high-level direction
/auto-research improve model generalization across different hospital datasets

# A combination of previous findings
/auto-research combine the attention gates from iter 1 with the larger batch size from iter 2

# An architecture change
/auto-research replace the standard convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions

# A training strategy
/auto-research add deep supervision at each decoder level with exponential weight decay

# A data augmentation idea
/auto-research apply test-time augmentation with flips and rotations during inference
```

The input can be anything from a vague direction to a specific code change — the agent adapts its paper search and implementation accordingly.

## What It Does

Each `/auto-research` call runs the full cycle:

**Idea → Papers → Code → Experiment → Results**

1. Fetches relevant papers from arXiv + Semantic Scholar
2. Generates research ideas, selects the best approach
3. Implements code changes via Agent subagent
4. Runs the experiment, extracts metrics
5. Records results, merges to main if new best
6. Presents a full summary with all iteration history

See [docs/pipeline.md](docs/pipeline.md) for the detailed 12-step breakdown.

## Iterating

Call `/auto-research` repeatedly. State accumulates — each call sees the full history and builds on it:

```
/auto-research add residual attention to nnunet decoder
```
```
Iteration 1: test_3d_dice = 0.88 (baseline: 0.85, +0.030) — NEW BEST

| # | Change                            | test_3d_dice | vs baseline |
|---|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | add residual attention to decoder | 0.88         | +0.030      |
```

```
/auto-research increase batch size from 2 to 4
```
```
Iteration 2: test_3d_dice = 0.89 (baseline: 0.85, +0.040) — NEW BEST

| # | Change                            | test_3d_dice | vs baseline |
|---|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | add residual attention to decoder | 0.88         | +0.030      |
| 2 | increase batch size from 2 to 4   | 0.89         | +0.040      |
```

```
/auto-research combine attention with deeper supervision
```
```
Iteration 3: test_3d_dice = 0.87 (baseline: 0.85, +0.020) — REGRESSED (best: iter 2)

| # | Change                             | test_3d_dice | vs baseline |
|---|------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | add residual attention to decoder  | 0.88         | +0.030      |
| 2 | increase batch size from 2 to 4    | 0.89         | +0.040      |
| 3 | combine attention + deep supervise | 0.87         | +0.020      |
```

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Copy into your project
cp -r research_agent/ /path/to/your/project/
cp -r .claude/skills/ /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/

# 2. Append protocol to CLAUDE.md
cat research_agent/protocol.md >> /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md

# 3. (Optional) Create progress.md with your research goal
cat > progress.md << 'EOF'
# Research Goal
Improve heart segmentation 3D Dice above 0.92.
EOF

# 4. Start
cd /path/to/your/project && claude
# Then type: /auto-research <your idea>
```
